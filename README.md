# python-trading-bot
A stock trading bot for beginners, written in Python. 

This repository is a living repository for a YouTube video series I am making about creating stock trading bots (AlgoTrading) with Python. 

The Example folder contains example code for working with the Alpaca brokerage trading API.

Copy and edit example-config.py into the examples folder before using the examples.
